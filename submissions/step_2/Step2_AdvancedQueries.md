However, their development is limited\nby practical constraints, such as accurate sizing of the\nbody and realism of demonstrations. We enumerate three\nopen challenges remaining for a complete and easy-to-use\ntry-on system that recent advances in machine learning\nmake increasingly tractable. For each, we describe\nthe problem, introduce state-of-the-art approaches, and\nprovide future directions.\n\nKeywords machine learning; digital try-on; garment\nmodeling; human body estimation; material\nmodeling\n\n1 Introduction\nE-commerce has grown at a rapid pace in recent\nyears. Consumers today are more likely to shop\nonline than to visit a retail store. The situation is\nmuch more complicated, however, when it comes to\nbuying clothes. People need to know how a garment\nfits on them, how it looks, and how it feels. Digital\ntry-on systems can potentially satisfy these needs,\nproviding a direct visual impression, and possibly\ncustomized clothes sizing as well. Therefore, it has\ndrawn much attention as an attractive alternative to\nimprove the user experience and popularize online\nfashion shopping.\n\nHowever, the technology is still far from practical,\neasy-to-use, and adequate to replace physical try-on.\nCurrently, most try-on systems rely on either image-\nediting, copy-pasting, or template demonstrations,\n\n1 University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20785, USA.\nE-mail: J.

Lin,\nlin@cs.umd.edu.\n\nManuscript received: 2020-06-24; accepted: 2020-07-21\n\nwhile the ultimate goal is a fast and realistic try-on\nsystem adaptive to each customer’s body. There is\nstill a substantial technological gap between modeling\nand demonstrating garment fitting in the digital and\nreal worlds, including fast and realistic demonstration,\naccurate modeling of human body and garments,\nfaithful modeling of garment material, and lossless\ntransformation of garments between virtual and\nphysical worlds.\n\nIn this paper, we present some open research issues\nthat contribute to this technological gap, including:\n1. accurate estimation of human shapes and sizes\n\nusing consumer devices,\n2. faithful recovery of garment materials via (online)\n\nimages, and\n3. ease of design and manipulation of sewing patterns\n\nand garment pieces by end-users.\nAlthough traditional methods have made important\n\nprogress on these under-constrained problems,\nlearning-based approaches have shown tremendous\npotential to make a notable impact. Compared to\ntraditional methods, machine-learning algorithms are\nusually much faster since training and optimization\nare performed offline. They are also good at\ngeneralizing to unseen images without the need for\ntedious data pre-processing. While extensive research\nexists on 2D image learning, machine learning of\nhighly variable 3D human body shapes is still far\nfrom mature, which is the reason why the open issues\ndescribed above remain elusive.\n\nFor each problem listed above, we motivate its\nimportance, provide a problem description, and\npresent state-of-the-art approaches with potential\nfor improvements. We believe that solutions to\nthese challenging problems will lead to significant\nadvances in digital try-on, as well as other areas of\ne-commerce.\n\n159\n\n\n\n160 J. Liang, M. C. Lin\n\n2 Open problems\nIn this section we first introduce three major\nchallenges that limit digital try-on technology from\nbeing widely adopted and accepted by shoppers.\nThere are several reasons why shoppers still prefer\nphysical try-on. Firstly, consumers are unsure if what\nthey buy online will fit them well. Although general\nsizing systems exist, their lack of consistency and\nstandardization across different brands and garment\nmaterials can often make it difficult to size clothes,\nespecially for persons with non-standard body shapes\nand proportion. Accurate estimation of human body\nshape is the key to successful digital try-on. Secondly,\nfabric is usually a key consideration when shopping\nfor clothes. Different fabric affects how garments\nlook and fit, how consumers would wear them, and\nwhether or not they would buy them. However, the\ncorrespondence between the actual material and its\ndigital representation are not well understood. It is\nalso challenging to acquire a full fabric digital model\nfrom real-world examples.\n\nFor the customers, appearance is as critical as other\nfactors. There are two approaches to displaying\ngarments: 2D image-based, and 3D mesh-based\nwith photo-realistic rendering. They have different\nadvantages and drawbacks, but both need a large\ngarment database for support. While creating a 3D\ngarment takes considerable effort, 2D images often\nsuffer from a lack of variation and are much more\ndifficult to customize. In either case, the try-on\nsystem needs a user-friendly design and manipulation\nbackend. Last, but not least, a fast and realistic\nanimation of the garments in motion along with\nbody movements greatly improves the user experience.\nAlthough it is not so critical as other factors, it\nwould effectively reduce the perceptual gap between\nthe real and digital worlds for online shopping.\nPrevious work has proposed using cloud computing\nto improve the animation speed, but there is still a\nnotable technology gap for high-quality, interactive\n3D animation of clothes.\n\n3 Human shape estimation\nAs noted, accurate human shape estimation is key to\nenabling digital try-on. Human body reconstruction,\nconsisting of pose and shape estimation, has been\nwidely studied in a variety of areas, including digital\n\nsurveillance, computer animation, special effects, and\nvirtual and augmented environments. Yet, it remains\na challenging and popular topic of interest. While\ndirect 3D body scanning can provide excellent and\naccurate results, its adoption is somewhat limited by\nthe required specialized hardware. RGB images are\nwidely available for input to digital try-on and can\nbe easily captured using commodity mobile devices.\nAlthough purely image-based try-on methods have\nbeen proposed [1], learning-based 3D body estimation\nis more widely applicable in that the 3D body can be\narticulated and so re-posed and re-targeted.\n\nWe define the human-body reconstruction problem\ninformally as, given one or more RGB images, to\nestimate the human body geometry and size, and\noutput (preferably) a 3D humanoid mesh. Traditional\nalgorithms often formulate it as an optimization\nproblem, in which the silhouette difference is a major\npart of the objective function [2]. Therefore, these\nmethods either require the human to wear tight\nclothes, or alternatively relax the target function\nto be unilateral on uncovered body parts [3], or\nto point correspondences [4]. The use of machine\nlearning methods in this problem has led to significant\nadvances. Firstly, it has moved the algorithm from\nonline to offline, significantly reducing response time.\nSecond, by using a parametric human model [5],\none can easily construct a regression network for\nthe parameters while the losses needed can also be\ninferred from them. While early works proposed\nnetwork models for only 2D/3D body skeletons [6–\n8], more recent works have introduced techniques to\nperform regression for the entire human body—either\nusing a parametric human model [9, 10] or a voxel-\nbased representation [11–13]. As annotations in most\nreal-world datasets contain only joint positions, the\nlearning process has been refined in various ways [14–\n17]. The current state of the art is the recent work\nby Ref. [18] �. It emphasizes shape learning, while\nmany other works often focus on body-joint losses,\nbut neglect the effect of body shapes.\n\nThe key contribution of Ref. [18] is a multi-view,\nmulti-stage framework to address ambiguity caused by\ncamera projection (see Fig. 1). Their model performs\nseveral stages of error correction. Each of the image\ninputs is passed on step by step; at each step, a shared-\n\n� Liang and Lin’s data and code are available at https://gamma.umd.edu/\nresearchdirections/virtualtryon/humanmultiview\n\n\n\nMachine learning for digital try-on: Challenges and progress 161\n\nFig. 1 Network structure from Ref.

[18], c© The Author(s) 2019.\n\nparameter prediction block computes the correction\nbased on the image feature and the input guesses.\nThe camera and the human body parameters are\nestimated at the same time, projecting the predicted\n3D joints back to 2D for loss computation. The\nestimated pose and shape parameters are shared\namong all views, while each view maintains its own\ncamera calibration and global orientation. Their\nproposed framework uses a recurrent structure,\nmaking it a universal model applicable to any number\nof views. At the same time, it couples shareable\ninformation across different views so that the human\nbody pose and shape are optimized using image\nfeatures from all views. Unlike static multi-view\nCNNs which have a fixed number of inputs, they\nmake use of the RNN-like structure in a cyclic form to\naccept any number of views, and prevent the gradient\nvanishing by predicting corrective values instead of\nupdating parameters in each regression block.\n\nExperiments have shown that, after training, this\nmodel can form a single view image, provide equally\ngood pose estimation as the state of the art, and\nprovide considerably improved pose estimation when\nusing multi-view inputs, leading to better shape\nestimation across all datasets. An example is\ndemonstrated in Fig. 2. Moreover, a physically-based\nsynthetic data generation pipeline is introduced to\nenrich the training data, which is very helpful for\n\nshape estimation and regularization in cases that\ntraditional datasets do not capture. While synthetic\ndata improves the diversity of human bodies with\nground-truth parameters, a larger garment dataset\nand a more convenient registration process are needed\nto minimize the performance gap between real-world\nimages and synthetic data. In addition, other\nvariables such as hair, skin color, and 3D backgrounds\nare subtle elements that can influence the perceived\nrealism of the synthetic data at the higher expense of\na more complex data generation pipeline. With the\nrecent progress in image style transfer using GAN, a\n\nFig. 2 Prediction results using the state of the art [18].

Lin\n\npromising direction is to transfer the synthetic result\nto more realistic images to further improve the result.\n\n4 Garment material modeling\n4.1 Introduction\nGarment material plays an important role in digital\ntry-on systems. Physical recreation of the fabric not\nonly gives a compelling visual simulation of the cloth,\nbut also affects how the garment feels and fits on\nthe body. However, fabric modeling is a challenging\ntask: the appearance and physical properties of\nthe garment are determined not only by the type\nof materials the clothes are made of, but also by\nsewing and weave. Thus, researchers often focus on\nthe physical behaviour, rather than the underlying\nsemantic primitives.\n\nHence, we state the garment material modeling\nproblem as follows. Given a sufficient amount of data,\nmodel the material’s physical behavior and physical\nproperties, so that visual effects the same as or similar\nto those of the real material can be reproduced by a\ncomputer. This has two implications: firstly, we need\nto define a physical model of the material, and then\nwe must estimate the parameters in the model.\n\nThere are many ways to model clothes, including\nspring–mass systems and finite elements. The latter is\nthe most popular model since it can produce realistic\nresults. While one can use isotropic properties such\nas Young’s modulus and Poisson ratio, an anisotropic\nmodel is a better choice since it can support different\nbehaviors caused by the weave of the material.\n\n4.2 Learning-based estimation\nWhile traditional optimization methods [19] often\ntake a long time to compute material parameters,\nmachine-learning methods can make predictions in\nreal time by a simple feed-forward operation, which\nis more useful in applications that need fast feedback,\nsuch as garment prototyping. The state-of-the-art\nmodel from Yang et al. [20] � uses CNNs combined\nwith LSTM to recover material parameters from\nvideos. To constrain both the input and solution\nspace, they choose one of the materials as a basis;\nthe material sub-space is constructed by multiplying\nthis material basis with a positive coefficient. To\nconstruct an optimal material parameter sub-space, a\n\n� Yang et al.’s data and code are available at http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/\nVideoCloth\n\nmaterial parameter sensitivity analysis is conducted\nto examine the sensitivity of the material parameters\nκ with respect to the amount of deformation D(κ).\nPhysically based cloth simulations are used to\ngenerate a much larger number of data samples within\nthese sub-spaces, which would otherwise be difficult\nor time-consuming to capture. The cloth meshes are\ngenerated through physically-based simulation, and\nthen rendered as 2D images with a randomly assigned\ntexture. Using the data samples, they combine the\nimage signal feature extraction method, a CNN, with\nthe temporal sequence learning method, LSTM, to\nlearn the mapping from visual appearance to material.\nAs shown in Fig. 3, the CNN layer is used to extract\nboth low- and high-level visual features, while the\nLSTM layer focuses on learning the mapping between\nthe material properties of the cloth and its consequent\nmovement.\n\nThey demonstrated the proposed framework with\nthe application of “material cloning”. With the\ntrained deep neural network model being able to\ncapture the cloth motion (Fig. 4), the material type\ncan be inferred from a video recording of the motion\nof the cloth in a fairly small amount of time. The\nrecovered material type can be “cloned” onto another\npiece of cloth or garment as shown in Fig. 5.\n\nIn this work, the videos contain only a single piece\nof cloth which does not interact with any other object.\nWhile this is not applicable to all real-world scenarios,\nthis method provides new insights into addressing this\nchallenging problem. A natural extension would be to\nlearn from videos of clothing directly interacting with\nthe human body, under varying lighting conditions\nand partial occlusion.\n\n4.3 Optimization using differentiable physics\nAnother approach to modeling the fabric is to measure\ngeometric differences directly during parameter\n\nFig. 3 Network model from Ref. [20]. The material is modeled\nby learning motion patterns of image features given by CNNs.\nReproduced with permission from Ref.

[20] modeled clothes materials in input videos (left),\nand applied those materials to a simulated skirt (right). Reproduced\nwith permission from Ref. [20], c© The Author(s) 2017.\n\noptimization. Assuming that the environment is\nknown to the system, computation of the estimated\nmotion and its gradient with respect to the material\nparameters can be achieved using differentiable\nsimulation. A typical usage of differentiable\nsimulation is motion control (see Fig. 6), where the\ndifference to the target is measured and the loss\nbackpropagated to the network. Similar processes\ncan be applied to material parameter estimation as\nwell. By measuring the distance to the target as the\nloss and computing corresponding gradients, either in\npixel space or in 3D space, the material parameters\n\ncan be learned or optimized to achieve the desired\ncloth motion or visual effect. Recent differentiable\nphysics work covers rigid bodies [22, 23], cloth [24],\nand particle-grid systems [25, 26]. The state-of-\nthe-art is Ref. [24] �, which proposes a method for\ndifferentiable cloth simulation. It is the first work\nto tackle a high dimensional simulation problem\nand to propose a general differentiable collision\nhandling algorithm. Later, a follow-up work [21]\nextended the algorithm to be applicable to coupled\ndynamics with rigid bodies. Overall, they follow\nthe computational flow of the common approach\nto cloth simulation: discretization using the finite\nelement method, integration using an implicit Euler\nmethod, and collision response on impact zones. They\nuse implicit differentiation in the linear solver and\noptimization in order to compute the gradient with\nrespect to the input parameters. The discontinuity\nintroduced by collision response is negligible because\nthe discontinuous states constitute a zero-measure\nset. During backpropagation in the optimization,\ngradient values can be directly computed after QR\ndecomposition of the constraint matrix. Their\npipeline contains several techniques that can be\nemployed in other differentiable simulations.\n4.3.1 Derivatives of the physical solution\nIn modern simulation algorithms, an implicit Euler\nmethod is often used for stable integration results.\nThus the mass matrix M often includes the Jacobian\nof the forces, and is denoted as M̂ to indicate this\ndifference. A linear solver is needed to compute the\nacceleration since it is time-consuming to compute\nM̂−1. Implicit differentiation is used to compute the\ngradients of the linear solution. Given an equation\nM̂a = f with a solution z and propagated gradient\n∂L/∂a|a=z, where L is the task-specific loss function,\nimplicit differentiation is used to derive the gradients.\nWe refer readers to the original paper [24] for more\ndetails.\n4.3.2 Derivatives of the collision response\nA general approach using LCP to integrate collision\nconstraints into physics simulations has been\nproposed, but constructing a static LCP is often\nimpractical in cloth simulation due to the high\ndimensionality. Collisions and contacts which happen\nat each step are very sparse compared to the complete\n\n� Liang et al.’s data and code are available at https://gamma.umd.edu/\nresearchdirections/virtualtryon/differentiablecloth\n\n\n\n164 J. Liang, M. C. Lin\n\nFig. 6 Differentiable simulation embedding example from Ref. [21]. The loss can be backpropagated through the physics simulator to the\nneural network, enabling learning tasks such as material modeling and motion control.\n\ndata. Therefore, a dynamic approach is used that\nincorporates collision detection and response.\n\nCollision handling in their implementation is based\non impact zone optimization. It finds all colliding\ninstances using continuous collision detection and\nsets up the constraints for all collisions. In order\nto introduce minimum change to the original mesh\nstate, a QP problem is developed to determine the\nconstraints. Since the signed distance function is\nlinear in x, the optimization takes a quadratic form,\nas shown originally in Ref. [24]:\n\nminimize\nz\n\n1\n2\n\n(z − x)TW (z − x),\n\nsubject to Gz + h � 0\nwhere W is a constant diagonal weight matrix related\nto the mass of each vertex, and G and h are constraint\nparameters. The numbers of variables and constraints\nare n and m, i.e. x ∈ R\n\nn, h ∈ R\nm, and G ∈ R\n\nm×n.\nNote that this optimization problem has inputs x,\nG, and h, and output z. The goal here is to derive\n∂L/∂x, ∂L/∂G, and ∂L/∂h given ∂L/∂z, where L\nis the loss function.\n\nWhen computing the gradient using implicit\ndifferentiation, the dimensionality of the linear system\ncan be very high. Their key observation here is that\nn >> m > rank(G), since one contact often involves 4\nvertices (thus 12 variables) and some contacts may be\nlinearly dependent (e.g., multiple adjacent collision\n\npairs). They minimize the size of the linear equation\nbased on the QR decomposition of G, which is the key\nto accelerating backpropagation of high dimensional\nQP problems.\n\nOne of their experiments shows its ability to\noptimize material parameters from observation. The\nscene features a piece of cloth hanging under gravity\nand subjected to a constant wind force. The material\nmodel consists of three parts: density d, stretching\nstiffness S, and bending stiffness B. The stretching\nstiffness quantifies the reaction force when the cloth\nis stretched; the bending stiffness models how easily\nthe cloth can be bent and folded. Table 1 shows\nresults. They achieve a much smaller error in most\nmeasurements in comparison to the baselines; the\nlinear part of the stiffness matrix is modeled well.\nWith the computed gradient using their model, one\ncan effectively optimize the unknown parameters that\ndominate cloth movement to fit the observed data.\n\nIn follow-up work, Qiao et al. extended the\ndifferentiable simulation pipeline to couple with\nrigid body dynamics, formulated using generalized\ncoordinates:\n\nd\ndt\n\n⎛\n⎝ q\n\nq̇\n\n⎞\n⎠ =\n\n⎛\n⎝ q̇\n\nq̈\n\n⎞\n⎠ =\n\n⎛\n⎝ q̇\n\nM−1f(q, q̇)\n\n⎞\n⎠\n\nand update the optimization formulation for collision\nresponse accordingly (see Ref. [21] for details):\n\nTable 1 Material parameter estimation results from Ref. [24]. Their proposed method runs faster than L-BFGS. Values of material parameters\nare Frobenius norms of the difference normalized by the Frobenius norm of the target. Values of the simulated result are the average pairwise\nvertex distances normalized by the size of the cloth. The gradient-based method yields much smaller errors than the baselines\n\nMethod\nRuntime\n\n(sec/step/iter)\n\nDensity\n\nerror (%)\n\nLinear stretching\n\nstiffness error (%)\n\nBending stiffness\n\nerror (%)\n\nSimulation\n\nerror (%)\n\nBaseline — 68 ± 46 160 ± 119 70 ± 42 12 ± 3.0\n\nL-BFGS 2.89 ± 0.02 4.2 ± 5.6 72 ± 90 70 ± 43 4.9 ± 3.3\n\nLiang et al.

When\ncomputing gradients, they linearize the constraints\naround a neighborhood as an approximation to enable\nQR decomposition for acceleration as previously\nmentioned.\n\n5 Garment modeling and design\nRealistic apparel model generation has become\nincreasingly popular, due to the rapid changes in\nfashion trends and the growing need for garment\nmodels in different applications such as virtual try-\non. It is already used even for state-of-the-art\ninteractive apparel design systems [27]. Application\nrequirements mean that it is important to have a\ngeneral cloth model that can represent a diverse set\nof garments. However, there are many challenges\nin automatic garment model generation. Firstly,\ngarments usually have different types of topology,\nespecially for fashion apparel, that makes it difficult\nto design a universal pipeline. Moreover, it is often\nnot straightforward for general garments design to\nbe retargeted onto another body shape, making\ncustomization difficult.\n\nPrevious work has addressed this problem to some\nextent. Huang et al. [28] proposed a realistic 3D\ngarment generation algorithm based on front and\nback image sketches, but it cannot readily retarget\ngenerated garments to other body shapes. Wang et\nal. [29] proposed an algorithm which can conveniently\nperform retargeting, but permits limited topology\nlike T-shirts or skirts. There is no recent work that\naddresses these two problems at the same time.\n\nWe introduce a learning-based parametric\ngenerative model to overcome the above difficulties,\ngiven garment sewing patterns and human body\nshapes as input. One possible approach would be to\ncompute a displacement image on the U–V space\nof the human body as a unified representation of\nthe garment mesh. Different topology and sizes\nof the garment are represented by different values\nin the image. The 2D displacement image, as the\nrepresentation of the 3D garment mesh data, can\n\nthen be fed into a conditional generative adversarial\nnetwork (cGAN) for latent space learning. The 2D\nrepresentation for the garment mesh can transfer\nthe irregular 3D mesh data to regular image data\nwhere a traditional CNN can easily learn. It can also\nextract relative geometric information with respect\nto the human body, enabling garment retargeting to\na different person.\n\n6 Conclusions\nAlthough virtual reality and digital try-on have\nexcellent potential and are rapidly developing, there\nremain open problems before online try-on systems\ncan be widely adopted. We have listed three major\nchallenges, all of which can be addressed or further\nimproved using machine learning algorithms. For\ngarment material prediction, state-of-the-art methods\nare still limited in that the training data is highly\nconstrained: the scenario contains only a piece\nof cloth floating in the wind. To improve its\napplicability to daily tasks, it is necessary to focus\non solving the problem on a more diverse set of\ninputs. Predicting the material from a garment\non a fixed human body could be a good start,\nbefore generalizing to arbitrary human motions and\npredicting multiple garments on the same body. In\nthe area of human shape estimation, it would be\ninteresting to learn how external constraints could\nimprove estimation accuracy. For example, the shape\nand size of the garment are hard constraints to\nwhich the predicted body should conform. While\noptimization-based methods can integrate these\nconstraints fairly easily, doing so remains elusive\nfor learning-based approaches. One possibility is\nto jointly estimate body and garment together and\nintroduce an intersection loss. This approach would\nrequire a new solution to the open problem of unified\ndeep garment representation, if we do not want to\ntrain one model for every garment type, which could\nbe even more challenging. We believe that substantial\nbreakthroughs in digital try-on are achievable with\nmore investigation in these directions.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was supported in part by the Iribe\nProfessorship and the National Science Foundation.\n\n\n\n166 J.

This article presents the very first systematic review of the technological \nadvancements in Neuromarketing field over the last 5 years. For this purpose, authors have selected and reviewed a \ntotal of 57 relevant literatures from valid databases which directly contribute to the Neuromarketing field with basic \nor empirical research findings. This review finds consumer goods as the prevalent marketing stimuli used in both \nproduct and promotion forms in these selected literatures. A trend of analyzing frontal and prefrontal alpha band sig-\nnals is observed among the consumer emotion recognition-based experiments, which corresponds to frontal alpha \nasymmetry theory. The use of electroencephalogram (EEG) is found favorable by many researchers over functional \nmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in video advertisement-based Neuromarketing experiments, apparently due to \nits low cost and high time resolution advantages. Physiological response measuring techniques such as eye tracking, \nskin conductance recording, heart rate monitoring, and facial mapping have also been found in these empirical stud-\nies exclusively or in parallel with brain recordings. Alongside traditional filtering methods, independent component \nanalysis (ICA) was found most commonly in artifact removal from neural signal. In consumer response prediction and \nclassification, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) \nhave performed with the highest average accuracy among other machine learning algorithms used in these litera-\ntures. The authors hope, this review will assist the future researchers with vital information in the field of Neuromarket-\ning for making novel contributions.\n\nKeywords: Neuromarketing, Neural recording, Machine learning algorithm, Brain computer interface, Marketing\n\n© The Author(s) 2020.

Marketing is the channel between prod-\nuct and consumers which determines the ultimate sale. \n\nWithout effective marketing, a good product fails to \ninform, engage and sustain its targeted audiences [1]. \nThe expanding economy with new businesses is continu-\nously evolving with changing consumer preferences. It \nis hard for the businesses to grow and sustain without \nhaving quantitative or qualitative assessment from their \nconsumers. Newly launched products need even more \neffective marketing to successfully enter into a com-\npetitive market. However, traditional marketing renders \nonly by posteriori analysis of consumer response. Con-\nventional market research depends on surveys, focus \n\nOpen Access\n\nBrain Informatics\n\n*Correspondence:  frawnaque@umassd.edu\n1 Advanced Intelligent Multidisciplinary Systems Lab, Institute \nof Advanced Research, United International University, Dhaka, Bangladesh\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1186/s40708-020-00109-x&domain=pdf\n\n\nPage 2 of 19Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.            (2020) 7:10 \n\ngroup discussion, personal interviews, field trials and \nobservations for collecting consumer feedback [2]. These \napproaches have the limitations of time requirement, \nhigh cost and unreliable information, which can often \nproduce inaccurate results. In contrast to the traditional \nmarketing research techniques, Neuromarketing allows \ncapturing consumers’ unspoken cognitive and emotional \nresponse to various marketing stimuli and can forecast \nconsumers’ purchase decisions.\n\nNeuromarketing uses non-invasive brain signal record-\ning techniques to directly measure the response of a \ncustomer’s brain to the marketing stimuli, supersed-\ning the traditional survey methods [3]. Functional mag-\nnetic resonance (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), \nmagnetoencephalography (MEG), transcranial mag-\nnetic stimulator (TMS), positron emission tomography \n(PET), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) etc. \nare some examples of neural recording devices used in \nNeuromarketing research. By obtaining neuronal activ-\nity from the brain using these devices, one can explore \nthe cognitive and emotional responses (i.e., like/dislike, \napproach/withdrawal) of a customer. Different stimuli \ntrigger associated response in a human brain and the \nresponse can be tracked by monitoring the change in \nneuronal signals or brainwaves [4]. Further, the signal \nand image processing techniques and machine learning \nalgorithms have enabled the researchers to measure, ana-\nlyze and interpret the possible meanings of brainwaves. \nThis opens a new door to detect, analyze and predict \nthe buying behavior of customers in marketing research. \nNow with the help of brain–computer interface, the men-\ntal states of a customer, i.e., excitement, engagement, \nwithdrawal, stress, etc., while experiencing a market-\ning stimuli can be captured [5]. Besides these brain sig-\nnal recording techniques, Neuromarketing also utilizes \nphysiological signals, i.e., eye tracking, heart rate and \nskin conductance measurements to gather the insight of \naudience’s physiological responses due to encountering \nstimuli. These neurophysiological signals with advanced \nspectral analysis and machine learning algorithms can \nnow provide nearly accurate depiction of consumers’ \npreferences and likes/dislikes [6–8].\n\nEarly years of Neuromarketing generated a contro-\nversy between the academician and the marketers due \nto its high promises and lack of groundwork. From \nthe claim of peeping into the consumer mind to find-\ning the buy buttons of human brain, Neuromarketing \nhas long been under the scrutiny of the academicians \nand researchers [9, 10]. However, academic research in \nthis field has started to pile up and the scope of Neuro-\nmarketing to reveal and predict consumer behavior is \ngradually becoming evident. Neuromarketing Science \nand Business Association (NMSBA) was established \n\nin 2012 to bridge the gap between academicians and \nNeuromarketers, and it is promoting Neuromarket-\ning research across the world with its annual event of \nNeuromarketing World Forum [11, 12]. It may be pro-\nposed that further dialogue may continue under such a \nplatform for further industry–academia collaboration. \nEvidently, more than 150 consumer neuroscience com-\npanies are commercially operating across the globe and \nbig brands (Google, Microsoft, Unilever, etc.) are using \ntheir insights to impact their consumers in a tailored and \nefficient way. Academic research, especially the high ana-\nlytical accuracy from the engineering part of Neuromar-\nketing has garnered this breakthrough and acceptance \nover the world. Hence, reviewing the building blocks of \nNeuromarketing is essential to evaluate its scopes and \ncapacities, and to contribute new perspective in this \nfield. Numerous literature reviews have been published \nfocusing the theoretical aspect of consumer neurosci-\nence, such as marketing, business ethics, management, \npsychology, consumer behavior, etc. [13–15]. However, \nsystematic literature review from the engineering per-\nspective with a focus on neural recording tools and inter-\npretational methodologies used in this field is absent. In \nthis regard, our article sets its premises to answer the fol-\nlowing questions:\n\n– What are the types of marketing stimuli currently \nbeing used in Neuromarketing?\n\n– What are the brain regions activated by these mar-\nketing stimuli?\n\n– What is the best brain signal recording tool currently \nbeing used in Neuromarketing research?\n\n– How are these brain signals preprocessed for further \nanalysis?\n\n– And what are the current methods or techniques \nused to interpret these brain signals?\n\nThese questions will allow us to gain a comprehensive \nknowledge on the up-to-date research scopes and tech-\nniques in consumer neuroscience. After this brief intro-\nduction, our methodology of conducting this systematic \nreview will be presented, followed by the state-of-the-art \nfindings corresponding to the aforementioned questions \nand synthesis of the important results. We concluded this \nreview with relevant inference from synthesized result \nand a recommendation for future researchers.\n\n2  Methodology\nThe systematic literature review is a process in which \na body of literature is collected, screened, selected, \nreviewed and assessed with a pre-specified objective for \nthe purpose of unbiased evidence collection and to reach \nan impartial conclusion [16]. Systematic review has the \n\n\n\nPage 3 of 19Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.            (2020) 7:10  \n\nobligation to explicitly define its research question and to \naddress inclusion–exclusion criteria for setting the scope \nof the investigation. After exhaustive search of existing \nliteratures, articles should be selected based on their rel-\nevance, and the results of the selected studies must be \nsynthesized and assessed critically to achieve clear con-\nclusions [16].\n\nIn this systematic review, we would like to explore \nthe marketing stimuli used in Neuromarketing research \narticles over the last 5 years with their triggered brain \nregions. We would also like to focus on the technologi-\ncal tools used to capture brain signals from these regions, \nand finally deliberate on signal processing and analytical \nmethodologies used in these experiments.\n\nTherefore, the inclusion criteria defined here are  as \nfollows:\n\n– Literatures must be published in the field of Neuro-\nmarketing from 2015 to 2019.\n\n– Studies must use brain–computer interface and/or \nother physiological signal recording device in their \nNeuromarketing experiments.\n\n– Studies must have experimental findings from neu-\nral and/or biometric data used in Neuromarketing \nresearch.\n\nThe exclusion criteria for this review are set as:\n\n– Any other literature review on Neuromarketing are \nexcluded from this review.\n\n– Book chapters are excluded from this review. Since \nNeuromarketing is comparatively a new research \nfield, alongside relevant academic journal articles, \nbook chapters conducting empirical experiments \nusing BCI can only be included.\n\n– Literatures written/published in any language other \nthan English are excluded from this article.\n\nTo serve the purpose of this systematic literature \nreview, a total of 931 articles were found across the \n\ninternet by using the search item “Neuromarketing” \nand “Neuro-marketing” in valid databases. Among the \nscreened publications, Table  1 presents the database \nsource of selected 57 research articles including book \nchapters, which directly contribute to the Neuromarket-\ning field with basic or empirical research findings.\n\nAs for the aggregation of relevant existing literatures, \nthe researchers defined that the search for articles would \nbe performed in six databases—Science Direct, Emer-\nald Insight, Sage, IEEE Xplore, Wiley Online Library, \nand Taylor Francis Online. After the initial article accu-\nmulation, the articles were exhaustively screened by \nthe authors by reviewing their title, abstract, keywords \nand scope to match the objective of this research. Once \nthe studies met our aforementioned inclusion criteria, \nthey were selected for further review and critical analy-\nsis. Table 2 classifies the selected articles in terms of the \naforementioned dimensions.\n\nBy exploring the articles selected to develop this sys-\ntematic review, it was possible to successfully categorize \nthe trends and advancements in Neuromarketing field in \nfollowing dimensions:\n\n i. Marketing stimuli used in Neuromarketing \nresearch\n\n ii. Activation of the brain regions due to marketing \nstimuli\n\n iii. Neural response recording techniques\n iv. Brain signal processing in Neuromarketing\n v. Machine learning applications in Neuromarketing.\n\nSome of these Neuromarketing studies have used \neye tracking, heart rate, galvanic skin response, facial \naction coding, etc., with or without brain signal \nrecording techniques to gauge the consumer’s hidden \nresponse. As they are the response from autonomous \nnervous system (ANS), they have proven themselves \nas successful means of exploring consumer’s focus, \narousal, attention and withdrawal actions. Hence, this \nstudy includes articles those empirically used these \n\nTable 1 Number of articles found and selected\n\nName of the database Results: search “Neuromarketing” Results: search “Neuro-marketing” Articles selected\n\nScience direct 281 55 12\n\nWiley online 111 11 7\n\nEmerald insight 115 8 14\n\nIEEE 34 0 14\n\nSage 12 15 6\n\nTaylor Francis online 106 36 4\n\nTotal found: 806 Total found: 125 Total selected: 57\n\n\n\nPage 4 of 19Rawnaque et al.

To conduct a system-\natic review on this matter, it is important to recall the \ninterconnection between brain functions with human \nbehavior and actions triggered by the  external stimuli. \nThe knowledge of brain anatomy and the physiologi-\ncal functions of brain areas as well as the physiological \nresponse due to external stimuli along with it, makes \nit possible to model brain activity and predict hidden \nresponse. For this purpose, current neural imaging sys-\ntems and neural recording systems have contributed \nmuch to capture the true essence of consumer prefer-\nences. This section will discuss the marketing stimuli, \ntheir targeted brain regions, neural and physiological \nsignal capturing technologies used over the last 5 years \nin Neuromarketing research. Comparing these signals \nwith their associated anatomical functionality some stud-\nies have already reached high accuracy. A number of the \nselected studies have used machine learning techniques \nto predict like/dislike and possible preference from the \ntest subjects.\n\nFor the purpose of Neuromarketing experiments, the \nfollowing literatures selected right-handed participants, \nwith normal or corrected-to-normal vision, free of cen-\ntral nervous system influencing medications and with no \nhistory of neuropathology.\n\n3.1  Marketing stimuli used in Neuromarketing\nAs Neuromarketing is a focus of marketers and consumer \nbehavior researchers, different strategies from market-\ning have been applied in Neuromarketing and they are \nbeing investigated for quantitative assessment from neu-\nrological data. Nemorin et al. asserts that Neuromarket-\ning differentiates from any other marketing models as \nit bypasses the thinking procedures of consumers and \ndirectly enters their brain [74]. Over the last 5  years, \nNeuromarketing stimuli has been mainly in two forms—\nproducts with/without price, and promotions. Product \ncan be defined as physical object or service that meets \nthe consumer demand. In Neuromarketing, product can \nbe physical such as tasting a beverage to conceptual like \na 3D (three dimensional) image of the product. Price in \nNeuromarketing experiments is mostly seen as a stimuli \nis most of the time intermingled with product or pro-\nmotion. However, it plays an important role that deter-\nmines the decision of test subjects to buy or not to buy \nthe product [75].\n\nConsumer response to a product has been recognized \nby either physically experiencing the product or by visu-\nalizing the image of  it. To understand the user esthetics \nof 3D shapes, Chew et  al. [17], used virtual 3D bracelet \nshapes in motion and recorded the brain response of \ntest subjects with EEG with motion. As 3D visualiza-\ntion of objects for preference recognition is a new area \n\nof research, the authors used mathematical model (Gie-\nlis superformula) to create 3D bracelet-like objects. \nTheir study displayed 3D shapes appear like bracelets as \nthe product to subjects. Using the 3D shapes gave the \nauthors an advantage to produce as many of 60 bracelet \nshapes to conduct the research on. Another new prod-\nuct was the E-commerce products presented to the test \nsubjects by Yadava et al. and Çakar et al. [18, 34]. Yadava \net  al. proposed a predictive modeling framework to \nunderstand consumer choice towards E-commerce prod-\nucts in terms of “likes” and “dislikes” by analyzing EEG \nsignals. In showing E-commerce product, they showed a \ntotal of 42 product images to the test participants. These \nproduct images were mainly of apparels and accessory \nitems such as shirts, sweaters, shoes, school bags, wrist \nwatches, etc. The test participants were asked to disclose \ntheir preference in terms of likes and dislikes after view-\ning the items  [18]. Çakar et  al. used both product and \nprice to explore the experience during product search of \nfirst-time buyers in E-commerce. To motivate the partici-\npants, this research provided each participants around \n73 USD as a gift card to use during the experiment. The \ntest participants were asked to search and select three \nproducts of their interest from an e-commerce website \nand reach the maximum of their gift card limit to acti-\nvate. Test subjects often experienced negative emotion \nwhile being unable to find necessary buttons such as “add \nto cart” or “sorting options” [34]. These Neuromarketing \nexperiments on E-commerce products may help develop-\ners to build better user experience. Retail businesses lose \nlarge amount of money when they invest in the wrong \nproduct. Among retail products, shoes have thousands \nof blueprints for manufacturing. Producing thousands \nof shoes of different designs to satisfy consumers can be \nlaborious and unprofitable since a large number of the \ndesigns turn out to be failures. Baldo et al. directly used \n30 existing image of shoe designs to show the test sub-\njects to and to choose from a mock shop showing on the \nscreen [39]. EEG signals were recorded during the whole \nshoe selection time and then subjects were asked to rate \nthe shoes in a rank of 1 to 5 of Likert scale. This experi-\nment helped realize brain response-based prediction can \nsupersede self-report-based methods, as the simulation \non sales data showed 12.1% profit growth for survey-\nbased prediction, and 36.4% profit growth for the brain \nresponse-based prediction.\n\nSimilar to the shoe experiment, Touchette and Lee [21] \nexperimented on the choice of apparel products among \nyoung adults, based on Davidson’s frontal asymmetry \ntheory. EEG signals were recorded while 34 college stu-\ndents viewed three attractive and three unattractive \napparel products on a high-resolution computer screen \nin a random order. Pozharliev et  al. [20] experimented \n\n\n\nPage 6 of 19Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.            (2020) 7:10 \n\non the emotion associated with visualizing luxury brand \nproducts vs. regular brand products. The experiment dis-\nplayed 60 luxury items and 60 basic brand items to 40 \nfemale undergraduate students to recognize the brain \nresponse of seeing high emotional value (luxury) prod-\nucts in social vs. alone atmosphere. The study found \nthat, luxury brand products invoked a higher emotional \nvalue in social atmosphere which could be utilized by the \nmarketers. Bosshard et al. and Fehse et al. experimented \non brand images and the comparison between the brain \nresponses associated with preferred and not preferred \nbrands [32, 33]. In the study performed by Bosshard et al., \nconsumer attitude towards established brand names were \nmeasured via electroencephalography. Subjects were \nshown 120 brand names in capital white letter in Tahoma \nfont on black background and without any logo while \ntheir brain responses were recorded. On the other hand, \nFehse et al. compared the brain response of test subjects \nwhile they visualized blocks of popular vs. organic food \nbrand logos. These experiments on brand image may help \nmarketers to recognize the implicit response of consum-\ners on different types of branding.\n\nAs price is mentioned as an important factor that \ndetermines the user’s interest on purchasing a product, \na number of Neuromarketing studies have used price \nalongside the products. In the aforementioned study \nby Çakar et  al. [34] price was displayed while recording \nbrain response during first-time e-commerce user expe-\nrience. Marques et al. [22], Çakir et al. [24], Gong et al. \n[35], Pilelienė and Grigaliūnaitė [36], Hsu and Chen [26], \nBoccia et al. [37], Venkatraman et al. [38], and Baldo et al. \n[39] have included price as a marketing stimuli with the \nproduct or promotional.\n\nAn interesting concept was tried by Boccia et  al. to \nrecognize the relation between corporate social respon-\nsibilities and consumer behavior. The author attempted \nto identify if consumers were willing to pay more for the \nproducts from socially or environmentally responsible \ncompany. Consumers were found to prefer the conven-\ntional companies over the socially responsible companies \ndue to lesser price. Marques et  al. [22] investigated the \ninfluence of price to compare national brand vs. own-\nlabeled branded products. In the experiment of Çakir \net  al, product then product and price were shown to \nthe subjects before decision-making time and the brain \nresponses were recorded through fNIRS [24]. Sometimes \nprice can play a passive role in the form of discounts or \ngifts in a promotional. Gong et al. innovatively designed \nan experiment to compare consumer brain response \nassociated with promotional using discount (25% off) vs. \ngift-giving (gift value equivalent to the discount) mar-\nketing strategies. Their study found that lower degree of \nambiguity (e.g., discounts) better motivates consumer \n\ndecision-making [35]. Hsu and Chen used price as a con-\ntrol variable in their wine tasting experiment. As price \nplays a pivotal role in purchase decision, two wines were \nselected of approximately equal price $15. Then the EEG \nsignals of test subjects were recorded during the wine \ntasting session [26].\n\nPromotion is the communication from the marketers’ \nend to influence the purchase decision of consumers [75]. \nIn Neuromarketing research, promotion is usually found \nas the TV commercials and short movies for advertise-\nment. One of the key focus of Neuromarketers is to \nevaluate the consumer engagement of advertisements. \nPredicting the engagement of advertisements before \nbroadcasting them on air, ensures higher rate of success-\nful promotions.\n\nIn 2015, Yang et al. used six smartphone commercials \nof different brands to compare among them in terms \nof extract cognitive neurophysiological indices such as \nhappiness, surprise, and attention as well as behavio-\nral indices (memory rate, preference, etc.) [41]. A com-\nmon experimental design procedure is found among the \npromotion-based Neuromarketing experiments, that is \nsubjects are first made comfortable in the experimental \nsetting, consecutive advertisements were placed at a time \ndistance no shorter than 10 s and consecutive advertise-\nments used neutral stimuli such as white screen, green \nscenario, blank in between them to stabilize the test \nparticipants.\n\nThe Neuromarketing experiments of Soria Morillo \net  al. [40, 43] tried to find out the electrical activity of \naudience brain while viewing advertisement relevant to \naudiences’ taste. They display used 14 TV commercials \ndisplayed to their 10 test subjects for their experiment \nand predicted like or dislike response from audience \nwith the help of advanced algorithms. Cherubino et  al. \n[42] investigated cognitive and emotional changes of \ncerebral activity during the observation of TV commer-\ncials among different aged population. Among seven TV \ncommercials displayed during the experiment, one com-\nmercial with strong images was analyzed for the adults’ \nand older adults’ reaction. Other than them, Vasiljević \net  al. [44] used Nestle advertisement to measure con-\nsumer attention though pulse analysis; Daugherty et  al. \n[46] replicated an experiment of Krugman (1971) using \nboth TV advertisements and print media advertise-\nments to recognize how consumers look and think; Royo \net  al. [47] focused on consumer response while viewing \nadvertisements of sustainable product designs. For their \nexperiment, an animated commercial was made contain-\ning verbal narrative of sustainable product and an exist-\ning commercial was used to convey the visual narrative \nof conventional product. Venkatraman  et al. focused \non measuring the success of TV advertisements using \n\n\n\nPage 7 of 19Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.            (2020) 7:10  \n\nneuroimaging and biometric data  [38]. Randolph and \nPierquet [51] showed super bowl commercials to under-\ngraduate students to compare the class rank of the com-\nmercials and the neural response from the test subjects. \nNomura and Mitsukura [52] identified emotional states \nof audiences while watching favorable vs. unfavorable TV \ncommercials. They selected 100 TV commercials among \nwhich 50 commercials were award winning which were \nlabeled as favorable advertisements. Singh et al. [56] used \npromotion in the form of static vs. video advertisements \nto predict the success of omnichannel marketing strate-\ngies. Ungureanu et al. [53] measured user attention and \narousal by eye tracking while surfing through web page \ncontaining static advertisements, while Goyal and Singh \n[54] utilized facial biometric sensors to model an auto-\nmated review systems for video advertisements. Oon \net al. [55] used merchandise product advertisement clips \nto recognize user preference. Singh et al. [56] used video \nadvertisements to measure visual attentions of audiences.\n\nMost of the TVC (television commercials) in these lit-\neratures had a standard time of 30 s. In Neuromarketing, \nthese TVCs were displayed in between other videos such \nas documentary film, gaming video, drama, etc., to cap-\nture the true response of consumers.\n\nSometimes Neuromarketing  is observed dealing with \nadvertisement of different purposes, such as social adver-\ntisements or gender-related advertisements. The appli-\ncation of Neuromarketing in social advertisement is to \npredict the success of these ads to reach its messages to \nthe targeted social groups [45, 49, 69]. Chen et  al. [49] \nexperimented on the neural response of adolescent audi-\nences while they are exposed to e-cigarette commercials. \nAnother social advertisement stimuli of smoking cessa-\ntion frames was used by Yang [45], to understand what \ntypes of frames (positive/negative) achieve better atten-\ntion from smokers and non-smokers. Gender plays a \nsubstantial role in advertisement industry from celebrity \nendorsement to gender-targeted marketing. Missaglia \net  al. [69] conducted a research on fast marketed con-\nsumer goods (FMCG) advertisements with celebrity vs. \nnon-celebrity female spokesperson. Casado-Aranda et al. \n[50] worked on gender-targeted advertisements using \ncongruent vs. incongruent product–voice combination. \nThese studies show us the diversity of marketing stimuli \nfor future Neuromarketing applications.\n\n3.2  Activation of brain regions due to marketing stimuli\nHuman brain is a matter of profound astonishment. \nThe anatomical development of our brain resulted in \nthe complex web of cognitive and emotional process we \nexperience every day. The evolution of vertebrate brain \nwas initially proposed by Paul D. MacLean  in his Tri-\nune Brain model  [76]. In his hypothesis, evolution of \n\nvertebrate brain is formed through three phases. First \nthe reptilian complex, which indicates the association \nof instincts with the anatomical structure basal gan-\nglia. The paleomammalian complex consists of sep-\ntum, amygdalae, hypothalamus, hippocampal complex, \nand cingulate cortex as the limbic system. These orga-\nnelles were associated with motivation and emotional \nresponse of mammalian brain. Finally, neomammalian \ncomplex consists of cerebral neocortex or the outer \nlayer of advanced mammalian brain, which is particu-\nlarly a unique feature of human brain. In the cerebral \nneocortex, we find four lobes which control our sen-\nsory, motor, emotional and cognitive processes [76]. \nThe triune brain model has been rejected by new neu-\nroscientists due to the interconnectivity of human brain \nstructures and their function. However, the anatomical \nstructure of human brain explained by this theory plays \na vital role in recognizing cognitive, emotional and \nbehavioral process.\n\nUnderstanding the anatomy of human brain has \nshowed itself indispensable in Neuromarketing \nresearch, as its functionality is deeply associated with \nthe interpretation of neural response. The outer layer of \nthe human brain is a complex system organized in four \nlobes, namely (frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital \nlobes), each having distinct functionalities for cogni-\ntive, emotional, and motor responses. The frontal lobe \nis the region where most of our thoughts and conscious \ndecisions are made  [77]. Cognitive decision-making \nmainly takes part in the prefrontal region of this lobe, \nand movement-related decisions are made in the end \npart of frontal lobe. Information about taste, touch and \nmovement is processed by the parietal lobe. The occipi-\ntal lobe is the primary center for visual processing, \nand the temporal lobe is responsible for visual memo-\nries, auditory recognition and integrating new sensory \ninformation with memories  [78]. Besides the primary \nlobes, cerebral cortex brain anatomy has gyri and sulci \nwhich create the folded appearance of the brain. The \ngyri functions on increasing surface area for informa-\ntion processing. Alongside the primary lobes, gyri of \nthese lobes can be considered as the region of interest \n(ROI) in neural imaging techniques [79].\n\nDeeper structures of the human brain consist-\ning thalamus, amygdalae, etc., produces sensory and \ninstinctual responses which are later transported to \nthe cerebral cortex. Hypothalamus works as the master \ncontrol of our autonomic system. Sleep, hunger, thirst, \nblood pressure, body temperature, sexual arousal are \ncontrolled and regulated by hypothalamus. Thalamus \non the other hand regulates sensory information, atten-\ntion and memory. Amygdalae originate our emotional \n\n\n\nPage 8 of 19Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.            (2020) 7:10 \n\nresponse and hippocampus is the mainframe of our \nmemory [77].\n\nRetrieving information from brain requires diverse \ntypes of methodology. In Neuromarketing experiments, \ndifferent parts of brain are selected for retrieving dis-\ntinct information. An experiment which solely focuses \non attention might only look at the signals from frontal \nlobe, whereas experiments focusing on buyer’s motiva-\ntion might want to look at deeper structures [38].\n\nAccording to Soria Morillo et al., brain signal acquisi-\ntion may capture neural signals either from cerebral cor-\ntex or from the deeper layer of the brain [40, 43]. Their \nexperiment on TV advertisement liking recognition ini-\ntially uses information only from prefrontal cortex using \na single electrode EEG device. Their experiment showed, \nit is possible to classify like/dislike with information col-\nlected solely from frontal lobe.\n\nSimilarly, Cherubino et  al. emphasized on the signifi-\ncance of frontal cortex (FC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) \nin Neuromarketing studies. PFC processes the conscious \nand unconscious cognitive and emotional information. \nHence, devices using only a single sensor select PFC as \ntheir signal acquisition region  [42]. Also, ventromedial \nprefrontal cortex corresponds to motivational behaviors, \nimaging of which by fMRI or MEG can reveal purchase \nmotivations [22].\n\nNeural communication in the brain is conducted \nthrough the action potentials, or the firing of neu-\nrons  [80]. A neuronal signal is the electrochemical \ninformation that neurons send to each other. These \ninformation are acquired as signals of non-linear pat-\ntern called the brainwaves  [80]. These brainwaves are \nfurther associated with the neural signature of brain \nstates. The neural signature is divided into frequency \nbands known as rhythms, such as the delta (0.1–4  Hz), \ntheta (4–8  Hz), alpha (8–12  Hz), beta (12–30  Hz), and \ngamma (30–90  Hz). These frequency bands are related \nto different brain states, regions, functions or patholo-\ngies. Delta (δ) waves are characteristic of deep sleep and \nhave not been explored for BCI applications  [81]. Theta \n(θ) waves are enhanced during sleep in adults and often \nrelated to various brain disorders. During wakefulness \nunder relaxed conditions alpha (α) waves with moder-\nate amplitude appear spontaneously. Beta (β) waves have \nless amplitude and are strongly related to motor control \nand engagement or decision-making procedure. Gamma \n(γ) waves are associated with movement-related activ-\nity of the brain and intensely observed in invasive neural \nrecording [81].\n\nIn Neuromarketing, beta wave amplitudes are associ-\nated with reward processing which can further predict \nsuccess of a product or TVC (Boksem and Smitds) [57].\n\nFrontal alpha asymmetry is a key concept of hem-\nisphere-based like–dislike classification approach. \nWhen the brain is considered as two hemispheres, left \nand right frontal cortices show hemispheric asymme-\ntry in their activation during processing positive and \nnegative emotion. Another term for emotional engage-\nment, Approach–Withdrawal Index refers to the emo-\ntional response from Frontal Alpha Asymmetry theory \n[34]. Frontal Asymmetry Index is a marker of approach \nand avoidance. “Emotional Engagement” in Neuromar-\nketing is expressed as the power of specific frequency \nbands from left and right frontal regions. The F3/F4 and \nF7/F8 electrodes are the best candidates for these EEG \npower reception as they are positioned at the most sen-\nsitive places (International 10–20 System). The alpha \nfrequency band (8–12  Hz) is commonly used in the \nfrontal alpha asymmetry theory. However, as the alpha \nactivity corresponds with relaxation and meditation, it \nis negatively correlated with cognitive engagement.\n\nFrontal Asymmetry Index is measured from the \nequation:\n\nHigher the Frontal Asymmetry Index value, the more \napproach response is obtained from the test subjects \nand vice versa. This high or positive asymmetry score \ncan determine pleasant feeling of a test subject and vice \nversa, which was explored in the study conducted by \nTouchette and Lee [21].\n\nNeuroimaging and neural signal recording devices \nuse these locations and brain states to map the mind of \na consumer. A standard 10–20 system has been estab-\nlished, which is an internationally recognized method \nto apply the EEG sensors or electrodes on a human \nscalp. EEG electrodes under 10–20 system have let-\nters to express their location on skull such as prefron-\ntal (Fp), frontal (F), temporal (T), parietal (P), occipital \n(O), and central (C). Even number of electrodes are \nplaced on the right side of the head.\n\nOn the other hand, a test subject is placed inside an \nfMRI machine where the activities of the cortices can \nbe recorded from the hemodynamic response or blood \noxygen level-dependent (BOLD) imaging process. \nfMRI can look deeper within the spatial range from \nmillimeters to centimeters. This enables Neuromar-\nketing researchers using fMRI imaging to examine the \nresponse at putamen, thalamus, amygdalae and even in \nthe hippocampus.\n\nFunctional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) \nis another new brain imaging tool which uses the \n\nFrontal Asymmetry Index\n\n= ln\nAlpha Power of Right F4 or F8\n\nAlpha Power of Left F3 or F7\n.\n\n\n\nPage 9 of 19Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.            (2020) 7:10  \n\nhemodynamic responses associated with neuronal \nactivities [24, 60]. However, fNIRS has a lower spatial \nresolution than fMRI and cannot look deeper than 4 cm.\n\nAlongside brain regions associated with neural \nresponse, the human has a peripheral system which \ncorresponds to cognitive and emotional processes. Eye \nmovement, skin conductance, heart rate, facial expres-\nsion all are result of neural processes. Eye tracking is \nprimarily considered as the physiological response in \nconsumer neuroscience, however studies have suggested \neye tracking as a result of activation of the visual cortex \nor a secondary neural response [34, 36, 38, 53, 70].\n\nNeuromarketing experiments focused on the affect–\ncircumflex coordinate or valance–arousal coordinate use \nautonomic nervous system (ANS) response from sweat \nglands of hands or galvanic skin response (GSR), and car-\ndiovascular measure or heart rate (HR). GSR is viewed as \na sensitive and convenient measure for indexing changes \nin sympathetic arousal associated with emotion, cogni-\ntion and attention. On the other hand, HR correlates with \nthe emotional valence of a stimulus, e.g., the positive or \nnegative component of the emotion [34].\n\nConsidering the available regions to capture signals \nfrom, it is highly likely that Neuromarketing will expo-\nnentially improve its recognition and predictions in user \nresponse and preferences.\n\n3.3  Neural response recording techniques\nThe groundwork in Neuromarketing field is evidently \nindebted to the advancement of neuroimaging and neu-\nral recording tools. Neurophysiological tools, such as \nelectroencephalography (EEG), functional magnetic \nresonance imaging (fMRI), eye tracking, skin conduct-\nance, heart rate, etc., made it feasible to conduct the aca-\ndemic and commercial Neuromarketing research. Many \nresearch-grade neurophysiological and biometric signal \ncapturing devices are now available in the market. How-\never, some devices have cost and mobility advantages \nover the others and therefore replacing the expensive and \nimmobile devices for Neuromarketing purpose.\n\nAmong all neuroimaging devices, functional mag-\nnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been the most \nwidely used neuroimaging technique in Neuromar-\nketing research during the initial time of consumer \nneuroscience. The reason behind the wide acceptance \nof fMRI is that it offers the identification of cerebral \nregions associated with cognitive and emotional pro-\ncess. Combining magnetic field and radio waves, fMRI \nproduces a sequence of images of the cerebral activ-\nity by measuring the blood flow of the cerebral cor-\ntex [38]. The signal imaged in fMRI is called BOLD \n(blood oxygen level dependent) signal. This technol-\nogy also allows 3D views of the coordinates that denote \n\ncertain location, making possible to investigate deeper \nbrain structures [57]. The primary disadvantages of \nthis method are that it is very expensive and till now \nhas a poor temporal resolution. The computer screen \nused in fMRI refreshes the image every 2 to 5  s. This \nlow temporal resolution to the order of seconds due to \nthe time requirement of the cerebral blood flow’s incre-\nment after being exposed to the stimuli, makes fMRI \nunsuitable for tracking brain activities to the order of \nmilliseconds, which is required in video advertisement \nanalysis. Other disadvantage is the head of the subject \nmust remain static during the whole image recording \nprocess [62]. This restriction causes complex preproc-\nessing and movement-related artifact removal from the \nfMRI signals. A number of studies, i.e., Venkatraman \net  al. [38], Marques et  al. [22], Hubert et  al. [25], Hsu \nand Cheng [26], Chen et al. [49], Casado-Aranda et al. \n[50], Wang et al. [30], Wolfe et al. [31], Fehse et al. [33], \netc., have used fMRI as the neuroimaging technique \nin their Neuromarketing studies. fMRI in all studies \nrequired the test subjects to remain static and displayed \nthe subjects the images and commercials of products \nfor 3–5 s. Later the subjects had to make purchase deci-\nsion within 5 s after their exposure to the stimuli [50]. \nResearchers over the last 5  years  are found using 3-T \nfMRI scanner 3.0-T Siemens Magnetom Trio system \nMRI Scanner equipped with a 32-channel bridge head \ncoil (Hubert and Hsu and Cheng) [25, 62] and 3 Tesla \nSiemens Verio scanner (Wang et  al. [30]). Cost of an \nfMRI machine can be from $500,000 to $3 million vary-\ning on its spatiotemporal resolution.\n\nAlongside fMRI, electroencephalography (EEG) is \nanother popular tool used in Neuromarketing research. \nNumber of research in Neuromarketing using EEG \ndevices is increasing due to EEG’s cost efficiency high \ntemporal resolution and mobility advantages. The EEG \nmeasures electrical activity in the cerebral cortex, the \nouter layer of the brain. EEG devices are placed follow-\ning the 10–20 system. According to the 10–20 system, \nthe 10 and 20 refer to the actual percentage of distances \nbetween adjacent electrodes which are either 10% or 20% \nof the total front–back or right–left distance of the skull \n[82]. As EEG is portable and allows capturing signal from \ncerebral cortex with high temporal resolution, it is mainly \nused in TV commercial engagement or success analy-\nsis. EEG signal of interest in Neuromarketing are mainly \nevent-related potential (ERP), and late positive potential \n(LPP). ERP and LPP are used by Pozharliev et al. [20] to \nmeasure the emotional value of luxury products. Çakar \net al. [34] used ERP to explore the experience of first-time \nuser of E-commerce product. Pilelienė and Grigaliūnaitė \n[36]) used ERP along with eye tracking signal to measure \nthe impact of celebrity spokesman in TVC. Shen et  al. \n\n\n\nPage 10 of 19Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.            (2020) 7:10 \n\n[23] used ERP and LPP to explore the influence of rating \nreviews on online products.\n\nResearch-grade EEG devices are vastly used in Neuro-\nmarketing. Emotiv Epoc and Emotive Epoc+ were found \nas the mostly commonly used EEG devices in the review. \nThese devices were used in the studies of Yang et al. [45], \nChew et  al. [17], Soria Morillo et  al. [40], Yadava et  al. \n[18], Royo et al. [47], Jain et al. [63], and Singh et al. [56]. \nEmotive Epoc+ is a moveable, cost-effective EEG head-\nset having 14 electrodes those cover the frontal, tempo-\nral, parietal and occipital lobes with channels AF3, F7, \nF3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, AF4. The \nacquired brain signals from Emotiv Epoc+ are highly \ndependable and have already been used in these scientific \nresearches. Another popular EEG device in Neuromar-\nketing, NeuroSky Mindwave, has only one sensor placed \non the prefrontal cortex of the head or the forehead. \nUnlike EEG devices with wet electrodes, Neurosky Mind-\nwave employs a biosensor which does not require any \nconductive medium to be applied on the test subject’s \nscalp [40]. With the help of NeroSkyLab, the provided \nscientific research tool, data viewing and analysis can be \nconducted easily by non-engineer population. In 2015, \nSoria Morillo et  al. and Ogino and Mitsukura in 2018 \nconducted Neuromarketing experiment with NeuroSky \ndevice and with the help of machine learning algorithm, \ntheir choice prediction accuracy was over 70% [40, 68]. A \n10-channel EEG device BrainAmp, from BrainProducts \nGmBh was used in the Neuromarketing experiment con-\nducted by Cherubino et  al. [42]. Another device EEGO \nSports from ANT Neuro (32 channels) was used to ana-\nlyze non-linear features of EEG signals by Oon et al. [55]. \nB-alert X10 headset from ABM consisting 9 electrode \nchannels is found in use by the experiment of Chew et al. \n[17]. 8-channel E-Prime from Neuroscan is another EEG \ndevice is used in the sales strategy experiment by Gong \net al. and Touchette et al. conducted their apparel liking \nexperiment with NeXus-10 biofeedback system. EEG \ndevices have different sampling rates starting from 128 \nto 512  Hz. This sampling rate determines the highest \nfrequency recordable by the EEG device. In general EEG \nhas a lower frequency spectrum, having Gamma band up \nto 90 Hz. This gives researchers advantage to choose the \nright EEG device from numerous manufacturers. Price \nof EEG devices depends mainly on the number of elec-\ntrode channels and performance. Cost of EEG device \nstarts from $99 and can go beyond $25,000, which gives \nresearchers buying flexibility.\n\nMagnetoencephalography (MEG) uses magnetic \npotentials to record brain activity at the scalp level, using \nmagnetic field sensitive detectors in the helmet placed \non the subject’s head. Magnetic field is not influenced \nby the type of tissue (blood, brain matter, bones), unlike \n\nelectrical field-based EEG, and can indicate the depth of \nthe location in the brain with high spatial and temporal \nresolution [3]. Similar to MEG, transcranial magnetic \nstimulation (TMS) uses varying magnetic field [83] gen-\nerated by electromagnetic induction using an iron core. \nTMS can stimulate targeted part of the brain, which \nenables it to conduct social or behavioral experiments. \nTMS and MEG are also used frequently in Neuromar-\nketing experiments. However, the selected databases for \nthis review did not contain any Neuromarketing research \narticles using these technologies over the last 5 years.\n\nThe electromyography (EMG) measures electrical \nactivity produced by skeletal muscles when the mus-\ncles contracts and expands in order to move the body \n[70]. Also EMG is generated from the autonomic nerv-\nous activity related to emotional or mental activity. In \nNeuromarketing research, facial EMG is the best meas-\nure of the valence of the emotional reaction as it records \nfacial muscle movement from two different muscles, i.e., \nzygomaticus muscle and corrugator muscle. Zygomatic \nmuscle is found to react more while exposed to positive \nstimuli [70].\n\nBesides these brain signal recordings, eye tracking \nis the most popular method for analyzing consumer \nresponse. Eye tracking offers to measure visualization \ntime and gaze path across a screen in Neuromarket-\ning experiments. Besides tracking eye movement, pupil \ndilation measurement allows one to associate audi-\nence’s focus and arousal to the marketing stimuli. In the \nreviewed literatures, Tobii Pro X2-30 system from Tobii \nTechnology was found as the most popular eye track-\ning device. In 2019, Etzold et  al. used this eye tracking \ndevice to explore attention research on online book-\ning [48]. Tobii Pro can also cooperate with fMRI-based \nNeuromarketing experiment (Venkatraman [38]). Other \nthan Tobii, Eye Tribe is found in use by Çakar et al. [34]. \nUngureanu et al. used eye tracking to measure the atten-\ntion level of consumers while displaying static advertise-\nments of cars and clothing products [53]. Figure 1 depicts \nthe most popular methods of neural response recording \ni.e. EEG, fMRI and eye tracking used in the Neuromar-\nketing experiments.\n\nSome of the Neuromarketing studies used heart rate, as \none of the metrics to measure arousal and focus of the \nconsumer while they encounter TV commercial stimuli. \nHeart rate is the speed of the heartbeat and it is typically \nmeasured by electrocardiogram (EKG). An EKG meas-\nures the electrical activity of the heart using external skin \nelectrodes. Heart rate is controlled by two antagonistic \nnervous systems, i.e., the sympathetic nervous system \n(SNS) and the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS). \nAutomatic response to external stimuli is determined by \nthe sympathetic system of the body. Activation of this \n\n\n\nPage 11 of 19Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.            (2020) 7:10  \n\nsystem increases heart rate, causing fight or flight mode, \nwhich is an independent measure of arousal [38]. In con-\ntrast, the calm and relaxed state characterized by slower \nheart rate is controlled by the parasympathetic system. \nSlower heart rate in response to an advertisement implies \nthe increased focus on the ad, hence provides an inde-\npendent measure of attention [38]. Another physiologi-\ncal parameter, skin conductance (SC), or galvanic skin \nresponse (GSR), develops when the skin acts as an elec-\ntrical conductor due to the increased activity of the sweat \nglands from exposure to stimulus [38]. Skin conductance \n\namplitude and response latency provide direct measures \nof arousal when watching TV commercials, unlike self-\nreported measures that are often based on later memory \nrecall. Although GSR cannot independently relate to \nemotional valence, some of the Neuromarketing studies, \ni.e., Cherubino et  al. [42], Çakar et  al. [34], Ungureanu \net al. [53], Magdin et al. [71], Goyal and Singh [54], and \nSingh et al. [56] have used skin conductance along with \nheart rate to measure the consumer attention and focus \non the TVC.\n\nFig. 1 Neural recording in Neuromarketing experiments: a multichannel EEG [43], b fMRI imaging [50], and c eye tracking for online booking \nappointment [48]\n\n\n\nPage 12 of 19Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.            (2020) 7:10 \n\n3.4  Brain signal processing in Neuromarketing\nSince neural signals and images are highly vulnerable \nto noise and artifacts, before performing any analysis \nor interpretation it is imperative to preprocess the neu-\nral signals to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). \nNoises that commonly accompany the EEG signals \nare cardiac signals (ECG), power line interference, eye \nmovement artifact (EOG) and muscle movement arti-\nfacts (EMG). Preprocessing in Neuromarketing consists \nof filtering the signals to the frequency bands of inter-\nest, re-referencing the filtered signal to a common aver-\nage, detecting and interpolating bad channels, noise \nand artifact removal, and framing or segmentation for \nfurther machine learning process.\n\nEEG signals usually spread across its energy from \n0.5  Hz to around 90  Hz. For classification purpose, it \nis required to have energies only from the relevant fre-\nquency bands, hence EEG preprocessing commonly \nuses band pass filtering techniques. Band pass filter \nrequires two cutoff frequencies, one upper and one \nlower to pass the energy between them and blocks \nenergies from all other frequencies. Band pass filter \nused in these  Neuromarketing experiments  are basi-\ncally the digital version of the filter mostly applied by \nMATLAB and EEGLAB (a toolbox designated for EEG \nsignal processing in MATLAB). Re-referencing to a \ncommon average reference is also found common after \nband pass filtering in the studies of Yang et al. [41], Fan \nand Touyama [66] to reduce possible shifts from exter-\nnal artifacts. Power line interference is usually found \nremoved by using a notch filter at 60 Hz or 50 Hz.\n\nThe reviewed literatures had some common \napproaches in noise removal techniques. Since the noise \naccompanied with EEG signals are random in nature, \nsignal averaging is a common approach to reduce these \nnoises. Fan and Touyama [66] averaged the ERP signals \nfor noise removal. Chew et  al. [17] used ABM software \ndevelopment kit (SDK) in MATLAB to remove 5 types \nof artifacts, namely EMG, eye blinking artifact, excur-\nsions, saturations and spike. Excursion, saturation and \nspike artifacts in the EEG signals are replaced by zero val-\nues. Then they applied nearest neighbor interpolation to \nreplace those zero values. Another type of filter Savitzky–\nGolay is found in use by Yadava et  al. [18] for signal \nsmoothing. For noise and artifact removal, the  4th-order \nButterworth filter was used in the studies of Ogino and \nMitsukura [68] and Oon et al. [55].\n\nIndependent component analysis (ICA) is an approach \nto separate the statistical subcomponents of EEG sig-\nnals. ICA is found as the most sought after technique \nfor removing artifacts and noise from EEG signals in \nthese articles. Studies of Cherubino et al. [42], Bhardwaj \net al. [53], Venkatraman et al. [38], Pozharliev et al. [20], \n\nBoksem and Smitds[57], Wriessnegger et al. [29], Fan and \nTouyama [66], Pilelienė and Grigaliūnaitė [36] all used \nindependent component analysis mostly for eye blink \nand eye movement artifact, and muscular movement \nnoise removal.\n\nNeuromarketing with fMRI studies have a different \nmethod for image preprocessing. Since the fMRI provides \na 3D image of the brain region with time information, it \nis basically a 4D signal. A 4D dataset is motion corrected \nfor any head movement, slice time corrected, spatially \nnormalized and finally smoothed to recover a denoised \nfMRI image. Wang et al. [30] used statistical parametric \nmapping (SPM) software to preprocess their fMRI data. \nTheir raw fMRI signal was subjected to standard preproc-\nessing involving correction for head motion, slice timing \ncorrection, temporal and spatial denoising and normali-\nzation into standardized Montreal Neurological Institute \n(MNI) space. The mean fMRI signal from each region of \ninterest was extracted from voxels in a sphere of 6-mm \nradius centered at the activation point in the regional \nactivation map.\n\nfMRI scan was also used by Hubert et al. [25] in their \nexperiment on hedonic vs. prudent shopper based on \nconsumer impulsiveness. Decision-making process with \ncognitive deliberation and the consideration of long-\nterm consequences are associated with processing in \nbrain areas such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex \n(vmPFC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). \nHence, these vmPFC and dlPFC were the region of inter-\nests to capture the BOLD activation imaging [62]. Brain \nactivation through BOLD signals was used by Hsu and \nCheng [26] to investigate negative emotion after prod-\nuct harm crisis. fMRI region of interest in this study \nincluded amygdala, left calcarine, striatum, ventral teg-\nmental area (VTA) and right insula. The amygdala is \nassociated with memory and subjective evaluation, left \ncalcarine relates to human visual processing, the striatum \nis associated with goal-oriented evaluation, and reward \nevaluation, VTA relates to decision-making process and \nmotive functions, and the insula regions are involved in \nconsumer decision-making related to negative reinforce-\nment. Acquiring activation within these regions affirms \nthe relation between stimuli and cognitive response.\n\nSignal detection and segmentation is the process by \nwhich the signal of interest is detected from the origi-\nnal signal and then separated for further procedures. \nThe energy of the signal may be used as a threshold \nfor detection of the signal. Often the Neuromarketing \nexperiments contain multiple types of stimuli shown \nto the test subjects. In such cases segmentation sepa-\nrates the event-based time signals for further pro-\ncessing, example Bhardwaj et  al. [58]. Segmentation \nor framing the EEG signals to a shorter time window \n\n\n\nPage 13 of 19Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.            (2020) 7:10  \n\nis mostly required to process the signal in time–fre-\nquency domain [58]. Cherubino et  al. [42] segmented \ntheir acquired and filtered EEG traces to extract the \ncerebral activity during the exposure to the market-\ning stimuli. Oon et al. [55] used 1-s segmentation time \nto extract non-linear detrended fluctuation analysis \nfeatures.\n\nThe goal of feature extraction is to find the set of \nfeature that minimizes intra-class variability and maxi-\nmizes inter-class variability. So we need to extract use-\nful information from the preprocessed signal, which \ncan be spatial, spectral or temporal [45]. As the EEG \nsignal is non-stationary, the feature extraction pro-\ncedure is quite often complicated. Discrete wavelet \ntransformation (DWT) is a viable way to extract fea-\ntures from EEG signals.\n\nYadava et  al. [18] performed DWT-based four-level \nwavelet analysis to extract features from their EEG sig-\nnals and decomposed the EEG signal into delta, theta, \nalpha, beta and gamma frequency bands. Another \nfeature extraction approach, principal component \nanalysis (PCA) was used by Venkatraman et  al. [38] \nfor extracting fMRI features in their Neuromarketing \nexperiment. In 2016, Fan and Touyama applied spatial \nand temporal principal component analysis (STPCA) \nfor feature extraction from ERP P300 signal. Rakshit \nand Lahiri [67] used a different approach to extract \nfeatures from EEG signals. They used Welch method \nfor one-sided power spectral density estimate and then \napplied a 256-point DFT algorithm on hamming win-\ndow of length 50 to extract features. Chew et  al. [17] \nadopted Hadjidimitriou and Hadjileontiadis methods \nin feature extraction where the feature estimation is \nbased on the event-related synchronization and desyn-\nchronization theory.\n\nFeature selection is also popularly known as dimen-\nsionality reduction or subset selection. This is a well-\nknown concept in machine learning which is about \nselecting an optimal set of features that decreases \ndimensionality, but has the most contribution to the \nclassification accuracy. In the past few years, feature \nselection has caught the attention of most research-\ners because of the nature of high dimensionality of \nbio-signals and the low number of sample data. Selec-\ntion of the optimal feature subset is always relative to \nan evaluation function. In most cases it is the evalua-\ntion function that measures the classification accu-\nracy. Feature selection techniques can be divided into \nthree categories, namely: filter, wrapper and embed-\nded approach. Wang et al. [30] used Recursive Cluster \nElimination (RCE) algorithm in spatiotemporal fMRI \nfeature selection. Soria Morillo et al. [40] used PCA for \nfeature reduction from their dataset. One-way analyses \n\nof variance (ANOVA) then cross-validation were also \nfound in use to identify the optimal feature set for cog-\nnitive or affective state classification by Yang et al. [41].\n\n3.5  Machine learning application in Neuromarketing\nUsing advanced neural recording method and signal pro-\ncessing tools, one can analyze EEG signals and interpret \ntheir correspondence with marketing stimuli. Frontal \nalpha asymmetry theory helped the researcher classify \nemotional approach/withdrawal response of the test sub-\njects using sub-band power of left and right hemispheric \nfrontal electrode [21]. However, classifying approach/\nwithdrawal or like/dislike without the FAA is possible, \neven possible from single electrode EEG signals. This \nrequires advanced Machine Learning algorithm appli-\ncation in Neuromarketing. Both supervised and unsu-\npervised learning methods were used in the following \nNeuromarketing experiments. Supervised learning in \nNeuromarketing uses a priori ground truth, usually the \ninterviewed response (like/dislike) from the test subjects \nas the labels. The labels help the classifier know the sig-\nnal pattern of like and dislike EEGs in the training data-\nsets. During the testing phase, like/dislike is predicted \nfrom a dataset without the labels. Researcher can hide \nthe training dataset labels from the classifier, and later \nuse it for accuracy calculation. On the other hand, unsu-\npervised learning approach used in Neuromarketing does \nnot require prior knowledge of the like/dislike labels. \nIt analyzes the signals with an aim to infer the existing \nstructures for different classes. Supervised learning usu-\nally solves either classification problem or a regression \nproblem. Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, \nArtificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Random Forests \n(RF) are the most common supervised learning classifi-\ners in Neuromarketing. In parallel, unsupervised learning \nin Neuromarketing has prominently the clustering type \nclassifiers, such as K-NN (k-nearest neighbors), principal \ncomponent analysis, singular value decomposition, and \nindependent component analysis (ICA).\n\nNeuromarketing researches over the last 5 years mainly \ndealt with like/dislike classification problem and pre-\ndicting consumer choice problem. Besides the learning \nmethod, both linear and non-linear classifiers have been \nused in these Neuromarketing experiments. The most \nused classification algorithms used in Neuromarketing \nover the last 5 years are Support Vector Machine (SVM), \nLinear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Artificial Neu-\nral Network (ANN), Naïve Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbor \n(KNN) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM).\n\nSVM is a supervised learning method, which requires \ntraining data for inferring a relation and recognizing pat-\nterns. SVM works as a discriminative classifier while a \nhyperplane separates the different classes. Based on the \n\n\n\nPage 14 of 19Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.            (2020) 7:10 \n\ntraining data SVM creates a hyperplane which further \nclassifies the new data. The advantage of using SVM in \nNeuromarketing is its computational simplicity and \naccuracy level. LDA classifiers are used in several litera-\ntures in comparison with SVM classifiers. LDA gathers \ndata points with similar frequencies as distinct groups \nand 1D Eigen transformation creates the separate classes. \nBhardwaj et al. [53] extracted energy and power spectral \ndensity as the feature from the acquired EEG signal and \napplied SVM and LDA classifiers to classify human emo-\ntions from EEG signals. Their model achieved 74.13% \naverage accuracy for SVM-based emotion (happy, sad, \nanger, disgust, neutral, fear and surprised) classification. \nIn contrast, the model achieved 66.50% average accu-\nracy for LDA-based emotion classification. In the P300 \nsignal-based experiment of Fan and Toyuyama, they used \nLD classifier to retrieve emotional faces from different \nsubjects.\n\nIn 2016, Ogino and Mitsukura experimented on a \nsingle-channel EEG device for emotion estimation for \nmobile application. Their study used SVM, LR, KNN and \nSVR together to create a model of valence estimation \nfrom EEG signals. They used two regression methods lin-\near regression (LR) and support vector regression (SVR) \nto define valence as sequential value from 1 to 9. SVM \nand KNN classified nine emotional classes, and SVR min-\nimized the number of sample errors. Rakshit and Lahiri \nused SVM and interval-type 2 fuzzy classifiers to classify \nred blue and green colors from EEG signals. Their model \nachieved the classification with 78.81% average accuracy \nfor SVM-based color classification [67]. However, IT2FS \nachieved the highest 80.04% mean accuracy compared to \nother classifiers in the experiment.\n\nThe hidden Markov model (HMM) is non-linear clas-\nsifier under another supervised learning method. It is \nderived from statistical modeling and is widely used \nin temporal and biomedical signals. In Neuromarket-\ning experiments, HMM is used to classify multiclass \nsequential data where transition from one mental state to \nanother mental state can occur. Researchers can find pos-\nsible observation of the states using the state transition \nprobabilities. Yadava et al. proposed an HMM-based con-\nsumer choice prediction (like/dislike) model using EEG \nsignals from frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobe. \nThey compared their classification model with standard \nclassifiers such as SVM, RF and ANN. Their HMM-based \nmodel achieved classification accuracy of 70.33% for male \ntest subjects and 63.56% for female test subjects [18]. In \ncomparison, accuracy of 62.85% was achieved with SVM \nclassifier with C = 6, whereas ANN with two hidden lay-\ners achieved 60% average accuracy.\n\nK-Nearest Neighbor algorithm serves both as a classifi-\ncation and regression algorithm. KNN algorithm predicts \n\nthe test sample’s category based on to the K training sam-\nples which are the nearest neighbors to the test sample. \nIn contrast to the hyperplane of SVM, KNN creates a \ndecision boundary among different distinct classes. In \nthe experiment of Chew et  al. [17], SVM and KNN are \nused to explore the esthetic preference for 3D shapes. \nThe mean accuracy for SVM classifier obtained was 68%, \nwhereas the mean accuracy for KNN classifier was 64%.\n\nArtificial Neural Network (ANN) is a form of neural \nnetwork classifiers. ANN is a collection of artificial neu-\nrons which produces non-linear decision boundaries \namong large number of classes. ANN and its different \nsubtypes are now becoming more common for the Neu-\nromarketing data interpretation. However, ANN requires \nlarge number of sample data and large number of fea-\ntures. Soria Morillo et  al. used ANN algorithm in 2015 \nand 2016 in comparison with Random Forest algorithm \nC4.5 and Ameva, respectively. In 2015, their advertise-\nment liking recognition model achieved 80% average \naccuracy with ANN and 69.4% for C4.5 classifier [43]. In \n2016, ANN, C4.5 and Ameva achieved average accuracy \nof 80%, 69%, and 75%, respectively.\n\nOon et  al. focused on recognizing preference among \ndifferent categories of products (food, automobile, etc.) \nusing KNN and ANN to analyze non-linear features of \nthe EEG signals [55]. ANN and KNN inputs were used \nas the features for Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) \nwhich achieved the highest classification accuracy 80% \nfor alpha waves, and 76.18% for beta waves. Doborjeh \net al. [64] used another type of Neural Network, Spiking \nNeural Network (SNN) to recognize attention bias pat-\ntern from spatio-temporal EEG signal. In their study, a \nbrain-like SNN methodology (NeuCube) was used to cre-\nate models from EEG signals to evaluate how attention \nbias can affect the consumer preferences. Their SNN-\nbased classification model achieved 89.95% average accu-\nracy, while traditional machine learning SVM classifier \nachieved 48.5% accuracy.\n\n4  Result synthesis\nThis section synthesizes the results from already dis-\ncussed research articles and book chapters with empiri-\ncal findings on Neuromarketing, published from 2015 to \n2019. To ensure the reliability of the experimental find-\nings, the reviewed literatures had largely set their statisti-\ncal significance at p < 0.05 [20, 38, 42, 43, 46, 59, 60, 70].\n\nWith the advancements in technologies, marketing \nstimuli have become more TV commercial or image \nof the product oriented rather than the original prod-\nuct [18–26, 34–43]. 3D image of the products have also \nadded to these virtual product purchase decision-making \n[17]. E-commerce products have gained interest among \nthe Neuromarketing researchers, since these products \n\n\n\nPage 15 of 19Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.            (2020) 7:10  \n\nare now more available to the consumers through online \nshopping [34]. First-time user experience in online shop-\nping and user experience in online appointment have \nalso diversified the stimuli group of Neuromarketing \nresearch. Other than these marketing focused stimuli, \nsome of the Neuromarketing studies focused on social \nadvertisements, particularly the campaign against smok-\ning and alcohol consumption among young adults. These \nsocial advertisements used neuroimaging and neural sig-\nnal decoding techniques to assess and predict the success \nof their message reaching the targeted social groups.\n\nAnalyzing consumer’s emotional response is found \nas a focus of current Neuromarketing research articles. \nThese experiments widely used Frontal Alpha Asymme-\ntry theory for left and right frontal channel. Besides the \nalpha band, beta and theta bands are also found in use \nin these literatures to recognize cognitive and emotional \nresponse of the consumers. Table 3 summarizes the find-\nings related to brainwaves and their functionalities in the \nreviewed Neuromarketing literatures.\n\nOver the last 5  years in consumer neuroscience \nresearch, the use of research-grade commercially avail-\nable EEG devices has become more popular than fMRI \nscanners. EEG has been particularly used in TV adver-\ntisement evaluation, where a high temporal resolution is \nrequired to explore the dynamic effects of TV commer-\ncials. Even though fMRI has been used less in the Neu-\nromarketing experiments, the use of fMRI is particularly \nfound when a consumer is displayed product images and \nasked to make purchase decision [30]. The reason behind \nusing product images as marketing stimuli in fMRI-based \nNeuromarketing research is that, fMRI can point out the \nactivated brain region when a subject encounters a mar-\nketing stimuli. The activated brain region can estimate \nthe positive or negative experience of the consumer in \ntheir brain. However, TVC changes stimuli in millisecond \ntime frame, response of which cannot be obtained by an \nfMRI scanner with 2–5 s image refresh rate. Other than \nEEG and fMRI, fNIRS has started to enter the Neuromar-\nketing research field. Having the advantage of mobility, \nfNIRS has been used in purchase behavior correlation \nand consumer reaction examination by Çakir et  al. and \nKrampe et  al. In these cases, fNIRS has shown accu-\nracy over 70% and scored in reliability scale 0.7 out of 1, \n\nrespectively [24, 60]. This shows fNIRS can be a promis-\ning mean of neural recording for future Neuromarketing \nexperiments.\n\nWhile comparing the EEG devices, Emotiv Epoc \nand Emotive Epoc+ had the largest number of aca-\ndemic research conducted through them. Other than \nthe 14-channel device, BrainAmp is a 10-channel EEG \ndevice and eego Sports is a 32-channel device used by \nNeuromarketing researchers. NeuroSky MindWave \ndespite having only one sensor, provided denoised EEG \ndata and performed well with accuracy over 70%.\n\nAll of the fMRI-based Neuromarketing studies over \nthe last 5  years have used 3-Tesla fMRI scanner Mag-\nnetom Trio, SIEMENS, and Siemens Verio scanner for \ntheir experiments [25, 30, 62]. The advantage of 3.0-T \nfunctional MRI is the high spatial resolution. However, \nBOLD signal-based fMRI has the possible confusion \nwith blood flow due to head or muscle movement.\n\nSignal preprocessing in the selected articles was \nmainly performed by using MATLAB and EEGLAB. \nBesides band pass filtering, increased used of inde-\npendent component analysis (ICA) in spatiotemporal \ndomain is also observed over the course of last 5 years \n[20, 36, 38, 42, 53]. Other than noise and artifact \nremoval, preprocessing dealt with framing or segmen-\ntation of the temporal EEG signal. The fMRI data were \npreprocessed using the statistical parametric mapping \n(SPM) software.\n\nIn this systematic review, a number of Neuromar-\nketing research experiments used artificial intelligent \nalgorithms for prediction and classification purposes. \nTable  4 compares the average classification accuracy \nachieved by these algorithms in the selected Neuromar-\nketing studies.\n\nWhile comparing the classification performance \nof machine learning algorithms in Neuromarketing \nresearch, we found the Artificial Neural Network had \nthe highest classification accuracy around 80% among \nall other algorithms [40, 43]. However, ANN requires \nmore training data than other classifiers such as 70% \ndata in training and 30% in testing, which calls into \nquestion its viability in Neuromarketing. After ANN, \nSVM was the algorithm most widely used in Neuromar-\nketing with the second highest classification accuracy \n\nTable 3 Functionalities of brain states used in Neuromarketing research\n\nBrain states Functionalities in Neuromarketing\n\nTheta (4–8 Hz) Frontal theta associated with cognitive process [59]. Theta amplitude increase for preferred color [18].\n\nAlpha (8–12 Hz) Frontal alpha associated with cognitive process [59].

HMM performed better than KNN in \noverall application of machine learning algorithms in \nNeuromarketing.\n\n5  Recommendation\nFrom this systematic review, authors would like  to sug-\ngest future Neuromarketing researchers to first define \nthe scope of their inquisition, which defines the rest \nof the process. Neuromarketing on product purchase \nassessment and purchase decision-making have been \nusing functional MRI to locate the activated region in \nconsumer brain to predict the success or failure of the \nproduct. However, to recognize consumer engagement \nwith product commercial, it is worthwhile to use EEG \ndevices with high temporal resolution. Neuromarket-\ning experiments with EEG devices of 14 channels and 32 \nchannels have established their research-grade perfor-\nmance. However, the raw data availability should be kept \nin mind by the researchers while selecting an EEG device. \nAlso, researcher should consider availability of bilateral \nEEG electrodes if they would like to utilize frontal alpha \nasymmetry theory. Accompanying EEG, eye tracking has \nalso shown high performance in attention and arousal \nlocating. Eye tracker, heart rate monitor, galvanic skin \nresponse device can be used alongside brain signal to \n\ncross-validate the experimental findings. While choosing \namong classifiers, although ANN has shown better per-\nformance consistently. However, authors would recom-\nmend preferring linear classifier over neural networks, as \nmost of the Neuromarketing sampling EEG dataset does \nnot contain plethora of samples to train a complex classi-\nfier as ANN.\n\n6  Conclusion\nNeuromarketing is an emerging field with opportuni-\nties in commercial, social and political advertisement \ndomain. The advancements of this field hence requires \nproper documentation to capture its state-of-art. This \nstudy was conducted with a focus to shed light on the \ntechnological scope and possible opportunities in this \nfield. Authors found over the course of last 5 years, Neu-\nromarketing experiments have been conducted mainly \nwith the stimuli of consumer goods, in both product \nand promotion forms. However, Neuromarketing is \nshowing its possibilities in the domain of social adver-\ntisement. Neuromarketing researchers tend to focus on \nthe frontal and prefrontal cortex of consumer brain for \ncognitive and emotional inquiries. Among all brain sig-\nnal recording devices, we found EEG is becoming more \npopular in Neuromarketing experiments, especially with \n\nTable 4 Comparative accuracy analysis for machine learning classifiers in Neuromarketing\n\nClassifiers Neuromarketing studies Average accuracy\n\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM) Like/dislike classification for esthetic preference recognition among 3D objects (Chew et al.) \n[17]\n\n68%\n\nAttention bias identification between targeted and non-targeted stimuli using NeoCube-\nbased SNN architecture (Doborjeh et al.)
